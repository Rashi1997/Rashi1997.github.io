Presented MONet, a compositional generative model for unsupervised scene decomposition and representation learning and
successfully incorporated an effective image segmentation method which integrates local spatial constraints to the baseline
MONet model. Based on a challenging Atari dataset, showed that our method significantly outperforms the conventional
U-net and the MONet baseline model. For future work, extend this method to multi-class image segmentation and cluster
the extracted objects based on their visual similarities.
