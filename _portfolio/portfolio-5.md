<p>
        This project analyzes the home page of 
        <a href="https://torontocupcake.com/#">Toronto Cupcake</a> website based on usability and accessibility standards.
        Next, I redesign the homepage of the website by sketching out lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes using Balsamiq Wireframes and Figma respectively. Using these prototypes
        I attempt to recreate the homepage in HTML and CSS (pointing to dummy links) to show how better design can increase the usability of the website.
