<p>
  For our UI/UX class’s iterative design project, we, 
  a team of 4 students, designed an app for a startup from TechCrunch’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/here-are-the-94-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-2/">
    YCombinator’s Day Summer 
    Demo list</a> based only on the startup’s concept. Throughout the project, we took no inspiration from 
  any design work that the startup has already done.

<p>
  We chose to design a mobile application for <a href="https://ilk.io/">Ilk</a>, a startup that seeks to provide safer 
  childcare solutions 
  for parents during the COVID-19 pandemic by matching families in a childcare pod to a caregiver.
